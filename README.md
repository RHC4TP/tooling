# Tooling by Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners
This repository hosts a number of tools to make life easier... for partners as well as team members, when performing certain tasks. Please note that these tools are *not* supported in any way by Red Hat or the Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners team.

Such tasks include:
* Preparing hosts for the installation of OpenShift Container Platform
* Standing up base infrastructure in the cloud (notably for running OCP in AWS, Azure or GCP)
* Interacting with the Red Hat Connect API for building, publishing and maintaining container images in the Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC)
* Additional tasks as tooling is developed (tools written in bash, python, go, Ansible, etc)

All partners and team members are welcome to contribute any scripting/tooling written to accomplish tedious (or even complex) tasks, with the only requisites being that scripts are tested and sanitized of sensitive data before being made public (no AWS keys, resource identifiers, IAM account names, passwords, etc).
